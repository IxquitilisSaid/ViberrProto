# ViberrProto

Tried to make and app with Djando. SPOILERS: Failed 

STEP 1: Unzip folder and cd to ../Viberr/viberr 
STEP 2: On the terminal, type "python manage.py migrate", followed by "python manage.py createsuperuser" and finally "python manage.py runserver"
STEP 3: Go to localhost:8000 on your browser 
STEP 4: For the signup page, go to http://localhost:8000/music/register/
STEP 5: Sign up, triggering an error msg
STEP 6: Go to the /admin/ page and congrats, your new user was added there.

This is the best I could do in 2 days and with no prior knowledge in Django lol
